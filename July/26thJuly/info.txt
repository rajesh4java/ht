data type are the means to identify the type of data and associated operations of handling it.

data type are of two types:
1 Primitive

1 byte
2 short
3 int
4 long
5 float
6 double
7 char
8 boolean


2 Reference type
1 class
2 array
3 interface
4 enum
5 annotation
---------------------------------------------------



following information can be obtained through the data type:
1 kind of value that can be stored in a variable
2 valid operations that can be performed on that variable
3 memory occupied by that variable

---------------

integer types:
byte 
short 
int 
long


floating types:
float
double

.....................

no. of bytes occupied
1 byte,boolean
2 short,char
4 int,float
8 long,double

.....................................
type conversion:
conversion of one type of value to the other type of value

1 type promotion
Implicit
lower type to higher type
automatic

2 type casting
explicit
higher type to lower type
not automatic
